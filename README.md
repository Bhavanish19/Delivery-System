Project Description :
We aim to create a system that allows the users to easily track and manage their orders. This system allows the customers to browse and place their orders with just a few clicks. Customers can view the products and see their price simultaneously.  In order to deliver the product swiftly, the product distributor will be shown an efficient way.

The Delivery System will include various parameters :
•	Payment details
•	Cost Analysis
•	Order
•	Return and Exchange
•	Rating
•	Recommendation
•	Delivery detail
•	Shop and vendor details
•	Admin

End Product :
The delivery system would provide users with immediate and efficient products. Users can search for the product, compare it, see current and adjusted rates, and select the best option for themselves. Users can also get information on old and new prices and can judge if the price is reduced or increased as well as get an option for a quick delivery option.
